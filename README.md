## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned that I can.
Front end mentor is a great site for newbies like me to skew away from tutorials and start coding from scratch. The idea of me taking this challenge was to test knowledge and help me with my confidence to start developing more projects.

### Continued development

This project main purpose was to help me "get my feet wet" on the full process of webdev. From the markup to the styling, all while using react and adapting to components and jsx.
The idea is to keep doing little challenges to help me with my learning and reinforce the fact that step by step im able to grow as a developer.
